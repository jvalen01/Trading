## Tradingview indicators

In this repo I have created indicators for the tradingview.com chart platform.
Written in pineScript. 

I use the built in API in TradingView to get information about stocks. 
Some of the indicators I have made help me in my stock trading hobby.

I have made:
- A performance table showing key info about a stock helping me make quick decisions.
- Moving averages and candlesticks for inside days.
- Alerts sending me a message when a stock moves a certain way.
